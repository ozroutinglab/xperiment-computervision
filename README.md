by Ozroutinglab

Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey to becoming a AI (Artificial Intelligence) / ML (Machine Learning) Engineer with additional OpenCV Computer Vision skills. This repository contains a collection of exercises and mini research projects that I have worked on to improve my skills in the following areas:

## Focus Areas

* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning
* Computer Vision

## Project Structure

Each project is separated into its own folder, making it easy to navigate and explore. You can browse through the folders to see the different projects I have worked on, and learn from my experiences.
