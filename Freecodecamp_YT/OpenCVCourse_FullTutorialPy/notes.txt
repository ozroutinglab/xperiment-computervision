--------------------------------------------------------
Learn everything you need to know about OpenCV in this full course for beginners. You will learn the very basics (reading images and videos, image transformations) to more advanced concepts (color spaces, edge detection). Towards the end, you'll have hands-on experience building a Deep Computer Vision model to classify between the characters in the popular TV series "The Simpsons".
