Do you want to understand how computers see images and videos? Using artificial intelligence, we can enable computers and smart devices to interpret what is in an image (computer vision).

This can provide massive benefits when it comes to automating tasks for which images are vital, such as examining medical images or enabling self-driving cars to see. Already, these applications are creating a massive industry around computer visionâ€”one that is set to grow rapidly, with some sources predicting that it will be worth over $43 billion by 2023.

This course provides you with a perfect foundation from which to understand computer vision and supports your professional development in this fast-growing arena. We first learn the basic concepts and explore these using OpenCV4, the most popular open-source computer vision library. Next, we explore using Machine Learning in computer vision, including the use of deep learning (using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras) to implement advanced image classifiers.

This course is designed to help data scientists, and those who already have some familiarity with ML and DL (and experience with Python, Keras, and TensorFlow), to gain a solid understanding of OpenCV and train their own computer vision deep learning models.

The code bundle for this course is available at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Computer-Vision-with-OpenCV-4-Keras-and-TensorFlow-2

This course is for data scientists and machine learning/deep learning engineers who are familiar with deep learning and want to build modern and highly-efficient computer vision applications.

Prior experience in Python (along with Keras and TensorFlow) is assumed. An existing basic-level knowledge of OpenCV would be beneficial but isn't mandatory as it will also be covered in this course.
